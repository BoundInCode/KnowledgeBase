How to Solve Nearly Every Problem
=================================

Problem Description
===================

Sublime Text behaves unexpectedly after one of these events:

* Installing new packages
* Updating existing packages
* Upgrading to a newer version of Sublime Text
* Editing settings files

Many features that were working fine up to now have stopped working, etc.

Solution
========

It's unlikely that your problem is due to bugs in Sublime Text. Revert Sublime
Text to a freshly-installed state and verify whether the problem persists. If
the issues you were finding go away, some of your packages or settings files
must be the cause.

In the official documentation you can learn `how to revert Sublime Text to a
default state`_.
